# Cdnizer

A quickly-built static site generator based on my previous project [Apache Indices][apache-indices].

All it does is scan the current directory and create index HTML and JSON files describing the contents. Designed
to be used before uploading a directory to an S3 bucket serving a static website of miscellaneous files.
